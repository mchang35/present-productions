    <p>
        THE PRESENT PRODUCTIONS is a production company based in San Marcos, California started 
        by Alex Chang in May 2022. Alex has been inspired by art all his life and more recently 
        has taken a keen interest in the film-making arts world where he hopes to continue to 
        build a career in film-making. The company's vision and mission is to work with young 
        aspiring film-makers, writers, actors/actresses, crew-members, community leaders, and 
        businesses to create exciting, provocative and new content that challenges those who 
        watch our films.  Alex will be attending the University of CA Berkeley in the fall of 
        2022, with plans to go into film-making studies, business and marketing.

        As a newly formed, student-led organization, we are open to all channels of opportunities. 
        Our initial plans are to start our work in the non-profit, community-based settings. Our 
        main content concentration at this time will be in creative short films. We hope to 
        continue to grow and build relationships, recruit talent, and increase our production 
        staff as well as our connections for continued future growth and ongoing audience outreach.
