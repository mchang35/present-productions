        Our current project is our first of many to come. "CONVENIENCE" is a short film 
        that tells the story of a teen boy living in the underbelly of San Marcos, California 
        struggling to pay for simple necessities. The teen boy, desperate to find a solution 
        to aid his financial situation, takes matters into his own hands by attempting to rob 
        a local convenience store.

        This non-profit project is a self-funded and community donated short film. The 
        film in its final form will be publicly distributed on a multitude of social media 
        platforms, and may be submitted to approved local film festivals. All locations for 
        filming will remain anonymous. All production members (including actors and extras) 
        will be donating their time and talent as unpaid work. However, everyone involved 
        will be credited in the end credits, obtain portfolio building experience, along 
        with gain potential social media exposure and recognition. Shooting will take place 
        over the course of 4-5 nonconsecutive days in the middle of June, not including 
        reshoots or extended days for filming. There could be work days that could include 
        weekdays and/or weekends as needed. Scenes will be filmed at various locations 
        throughout the city of San Marcos. We are excited to bring this short film to life 
        and look forward casting, filming and producing this. If anyone wants to take part 
        in any aspects of this production, please contact us.
